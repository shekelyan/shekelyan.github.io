      <h3>Slow and steady wins the race</h3>
      
      <a href="https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=%22slow+science">Slow science</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_science">recent term</a> to promote a stronger focus on solid, curiosity-driven research instead of quick and sloppy works to evade the "perish" part of the "publish or perish" paradigm. Fast science like fast food makes things happen quickly, but limits our scope to hasty fry-ups.
      
     <h3>Why do authors publish so many papers?</h3>
	
	It is easier to focus on many papers instead of fewer more substantial works:
	
	<ul>
	<li>Randomness in peer-review favours quantity of submissions over quality</li>
	<li>Plenty of exotic problems or problem variations that are easy to solve</li>
	<li>Appearance of substance can be achieved by overcomplicating things</li>
	<li>Substantial works are more disruptive and tend to meet more opposition</li> 
	<li>It is often not scrutinised how well a paper meets the promises it makes</li>
	</ul>
	
	There are various incentives:
	<ul>
	<li>Authors with many papers on a subject are perceived as experts</li>
	<li>Career progression can be tied to quotas</li>
	<li>More papers means more say on which authors receive most citations</li>
	</ul>
	
	There are no penalties:
	<ul>
	<li>Padding a research portfolio never hurts</li>
	<li>The true scientific value of a paper is hidden away from plain view</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Do authors perish if they focus on fewer, but more substantial works?</h3>
      
	In some disciplines authors may have the option of targeting more selective venues that
	set higher standards for quality, which can then be very prestigious. Yet many of the previously issues remain.
	The selectivity of the venues may also not be very well known and the prestige only extend to certain subcommunities. 
	Matters are made worse that it is completely subjective, e.g., only looking at acceptance
	rates of a venue indicates very little about their quality.
	
	<h3>How could well-intentioned researchers be helped?</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Try to make <a href="https://compsci.science/reviewing">reviewing</a> in selective venues less random</li>
	<li>Prioritise quality over quantity</li>
	<li>Consider both the best and worst publications in a research portfolio</li>
	<li>Focus less on quantitative metrics</li>
	<li>Be more open-minded about disruptive works</li>
	</ul>
